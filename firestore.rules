/**
 * @file firestore.rules
 * @description Security rules for the Autonomous Vehicle Threat Detection System.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict server-centric security model. All data mutations
 * (creates, updates, deletes) are expected to originate from a trusted backend
 * environment (e.g., Cloud Functions, a server with the Admin SDK) which bypasses
 * these client-facing rules. Client-side applications are effectively granted
 * read-only access to prevent unauthorized data manipulation.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into a flat structure with two top-level collections:
 * `/vehicleCommunicationLogs` and `/sybilDetectionResults`. This design avoids
 * hierarchical dependencies and the need for costly `get()` calls in security rules,
 * making authorization checks simple and performant.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * 1. Backend-Only Writes: All write operations (`create`, `update`, `delete`) are
 *    explicitly denied for client SDKs. This is the cornerstone of the security
 *    model, ensuring data integrity by routing all changes through a controlled
 *    backend service.
 * 2. Public Read Access: Data within the collections is considered non-sensitive
 *    and is made available for public read (`get`, `list`). This supports client-side
 *    applications that need to display detection results or log data without
 *    requiring user authentication.
 * 3. No User Ownership: The data model does not associate records with specific
 *    users, so there are no ownership-based rules. Access is controlled at the
 *    collection level, not on a per-document basis.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This principle is not heavily utilized as there are no user-specific permissions.
 * The flat data structure inherently avoids the need to denormalize ownership or
 * role data for authorization purposes.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The clear separation of `vehicleCommunicationLogs` and `sybilDetectionResults`
 * into distinct top-level collections provides a clean and secure boundary for
 * applying broad access policies.
